# arbit-video-helper — the GPL video sidecar for DonutStudio

This directory is the **complete corresponding source** for the
`arbit-video-helper` executable that ships inside the DonutStudio
installers and zips (Windows, macOS, Linux). DonutStudio itself is a
closed-source application; all of its video functionality lives in this
separate GPL-licensed sidecar process, and publishing this directory in
the public DonutStudio repository is how we satisfy the GPL source-access
obligation for those bundled binaries.

The internal names (`arbit-video-helper`, `arbit_*` symbols, `ARBIT_*`
CMake options) come from Arbit, the product's former name, and are kept
as-is so the published source matches the shipped binaries exactly.

## What it does

The helper owns everything that touches FFmpeg and other GPL/LGPL media
libraries, which must never be linked into the proprietary DonutStudio
binaries:

- video decode and thumbnailing
- audio extraction and beat detection (aubio, optional)
- the OpenGL render/compositing engine used by the video editor
  (generators, shaders, adjustment clips, mod matrix, Lua/JS hooks)
- video export (encode via FFmpeg, including x264/x265 where enabled)
- optional RIFE frame interpolation (ncnn-Vulkan by default, ONNX Runtime
  optionally); model weights are downloaded at first use, not bundled —
  see `PROTOCOL.md` for provenance and pinned hashes

## How DonutStudio talks to it

- **JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout** for commands — the full protocol is
  documented in [`PROTOCOL.md`](PROTOCOL.md), with the ping/pong and
  lifecycle rules in [`PINGPONG.md`](PINGPONG.md).
- **A shared-memory frame ring** for decoded RGBA frames
  ([`shared/VideoFrameSharedMemory.h`](shared/VideoFrameSharedMemory.h)).
- **An optional zero-copy GPU surface channel** (dmabuf / IOSurface /
  D3D11 shared textures over a unix-domain socket,
  [`shared/SharedGpuSurfaceProtocol.h`](shared/SharedGpuSurfaceProtocol.h)).

The two headers in `shared/` are the process boundary: dependency-free
POD/IPC protocol definitions that are compiled into both the proprietary
plugin and this GPL helper. In the private tree they live at
`plugin/Source/`; they are vendored here (and the include path adjusted
in `CMakeLists.txt`) so this directory builds standalone.

## Building

The helper is a standalone CMake project — configure from this directory:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
ninja -C build
# → build/arbit-video-helper
```

Key CMake options:

- `ARBIT_WITH_NCNN` (default **ON**) — RIFE frame interpolation via
  ncnn + Vulkan (ncnn is fetched and built from source via FetchContent,
  with the patch in `patches/`)
- `ARBIT_NCNN_ZEROCOPY` (default ON on Linux) — zero-copy Vulkan→GL
  RIFE output; needs `libvulkan-dev` at build time
- `ARBIT_WITH_ONNX` (default OFF) — alternative RIFE backend via a
  prebuilt ONNX Runtime download

### Linux

Official binaries are built in an Ubuntu 24.04 container (the helper
needs FFmpeg 6's channel-layout API, so Ubuntu 22.04's FFmpeg 4.4 is too
old). Build dependencies:

```sh
apt-get install cmake ninja-build pkg-config build-essential git \
    libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavutil-dev \
    libswscale-dev libswresample-dev libavfilter-dev \
    libaubio-dev nlohmann-json3-dev libvulkan-dev
```

then run the `cmake`/`ninja` commands above. Optional extras picked up
via pkg-config when present: `aubio` (beat detection), `lua5.4`/`lua5.3`
(Lua frame hooks), `glfw3` + OpenGL/EGL (render engine, viewport).

### Windows

Official Windows binaries are cross-compiled from Linux with
MinGW-w64 (POSIX threads variant) against the unmodified MSYS2 MINGW64
packages for FFmpeg, aubio, GLFW, etc.:

```sh
# toolchain: g++-mingw-w64-x86-64 (posix), cmake, ninja
cmake -S . -B build-win -G Ninja \
    -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<mingw-w64-x86_64 toolchain file> \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
ninja -C build-win
```

with `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`/`PKG_CONFIG` pointed at an MSYS2 MINGW64
sysroot (packages from <https://packages.msys2.org>). A native MSYS2
MINGW64 shell build with the same packages works too. The DLLs shipped
next to the exe in the DonutStudio Windows bundle are those unmodified
MSYS2 packages (see `NOTICE.md` for source pointers).

### macOS

Native build with the dependencies from Homebrew
(`ffmpeg`, `aubio`, `glfw`, `nlohmann-json`, `lua`, `pkg-config`):

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

## License

`arbit-video-helper` is licensed **GPL-2.0-or-later** — see
[`COPYING`](COPYING) for the full GNU General Public License version 2
text.

Vendored third-party code in this tree (QuickJS-ng, SPIRV-Cross,
rife-ncnn-vulkan net code) is under MIT / dual Apache-2.0-OR-MIT
licenses; see [`NOTICE.md`](NOTICE.md) for details, including the note
that we elect the MIT option for SPIRV-Cross. Because the shipped
binaries link GPL-licensed FFmpeg builds (with x264/x265) and, where
enabled, aubio (GPL-3.0-or-later), the **effective license of the
distributed helper binaries is GPL-3.0-or-later**; the source in this
directory remains available under GPL-2.0-or-later as declared in
`CMakeLists.txt`.

## Release correspondence

This source corresponds to the `arbit-video-helper` binaries shipped
with **DonutStudio v0.5.1**. (The helper's internal `project()` version
is a static `0.1.0` and does not track app releases; correlate by app
version.) Future DonutStudio releases that change the helper will update
this directory in lockstep.

If you want the exact corresponding source archive for the helper binary
in any specific DonutStudio release, or for any of the third-party
libraries bundled alongside it, open an issue on this repository and we
will provide it.
